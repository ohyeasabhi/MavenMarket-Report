Hello Data Analysts

This is a file for a project created by me while doing the course "Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence".

Steps to Run the Report:

Download and Install the Power BI Desktop app on your Windows or MacOS from official Site: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494
Download the "AdventureWorks Report_FINAL" file from this repository.
Open it in your system, and have a look on the Report.
